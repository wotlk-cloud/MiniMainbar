Added a check for InCombatLockdown in the update GUI function to (hopefully) stop any taint stemming from the vehiclemenubar -> mainmenubar transition.  Tested on a gunship fight tonight and didn't have one failure to transition, so it looks promising.

Think I finally fixed the vehicle problem, I believe I was using the wrong function to block the main bar from updating.  Also added code to make VehicleMenuBar use the MainMenuBar scaling.

Was hooking into the thing, I think.  Had to hook into the PLAYER_LOSES_VEHICLE_DATA event.  Preliminary testing at the Argent tournament getting knocked off mounts by NPCs is promising.  I haven't had one failure to reload the main bar after transitioning from the vehicle bar.

Yet another attempt to fix the vehicle/main bar swap issue where the main bar doesn't show back up.  I attempted to hook into MainMenuBar_ToPlayerArt and then force it to call my GUI refresh code from there.  After digging through Blizzard's code it looks like ToPlayerArt is the final function called after a player leaves a vehicle.

Bug-fix: Think I fixed the problem where if you were forced to dismount from a vehicle it wasn't placing the main bar in the right location.

Show on mouseover now (mostly) working for the micromenu, bag bar, and pet bar.  The stance bar is a bit... different and will take more effort to get working right.

Added two slash command /mmb and /minimainbar which both open up to the options frame.

Added a general section to the options menu so artwork and main bar scale can be controlled through the GUI.

Added experimental show on mouse over for the micromenu and the bags bar.  Still looking into if how I did it is the best way to accomplish it.

Removed a line from .pkgmeta that will hopefully stop the Curse client from downloading Ace3 seperately from MiniMainBar.
